                <h3>SAFE CITY PROJECT
                    <br>
                    1. To integrate the safe city project of MP Police with dial 100/112.
                    Various projects on the safe city have been launched by MP police; similarly dial 100/112 emergency
                    services are already functioning well. Participants are encouraged to design & develop
                    methods/techniques for integrating these safe city projects with dial 100/112. Some of the examples
                    are quoted here:
                    ⦁ Identifies Potential Hazards
                    ⦁ Protects Residents and the Neighborhood
                    ⦁ Ensures Compliance
                    ⦁ Helps Prevents Accidents

                <h3> CCTV CONTROL ROOM <br>

                    •Ideas are welcome to design systems for the integration of CCTV cameras at public & semi-public
                    premises with central control room so that effective policing can be performed within the time
                    frame.</h3>

                <h3> ANTI-DRONE SYSTEM
                    <br>
                    1. To design solution architecture for the Anti-drone System for MP Police to thwart the mission of
                    the rogue drone.
                    Anti-drone systems detect and or intercept unwanted drones and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). They
                    are deployed to protect areas such as airports, critical infrastructure, large public spaces such as
                    stadiums, and military installations and battlefields.

                    Following are some of the drone monitoring techniques to thwart the mission of a rogue drone.
                    ⦁ Radio Frequency (RF) Analyzers
                    ⦁ Acoustic Sensors (Microphones)
                    ⦁ Optical Sensors (Cameras),
                    ⦁ Radar
